button works off hz rate. For instance the starting hertz rate is over 65000. the output of the LED is based on how long the button is pushed at a rate of 250 hz for a maximum of 16 seconds for most of the code. meaning based on how long you hold the button, that value "i" will be subtracted from the "starting" hertz rate of the LED.
